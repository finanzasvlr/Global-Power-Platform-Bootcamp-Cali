As we countdown to the 7th edition of the Global Power Platform & Agent Bootcamp (GPPB) 2026, excitement within our community is at an all-time high! This year, as we continue our journey of learning and innovation, we’re thrilled to unite over 80 locations worldwide for this landmark event.

What's New This Year:
This year, we are introducing post-event learning resources in collaboration with Microsoft. Please ensure that all local organizers share the following links with every participant after the event:

Applied skills: https://aka.ms/GPPBAppliedskills
Adoption resources: https://aka.ms/GPPABResource

A dedicated slide for these resources has also been included in the kickoff deck.


We are also introducing a new option for attendees to claim their participation certificate. Please share the following link with all participants:https://bit.ly/GPPBClaimCert.
